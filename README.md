# PasswordGenerator

The purpose of this assingment was to create a "Password Generator" using "Javascript." I used the following languages to deliver this appilcation:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript

The purpose of this application was to generate a password based on the criteria selected by the user. The algorithm will consider all the required standards and randomly create a password that would satisfy all requirements. 

This application was built using "Visual Studio Code".
